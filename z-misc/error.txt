> First, thanks for the detailed report! It helps me tremendously

Glad to hear it, you're welcome!

> I can't really see any reasons for changing the cmd for Omnisharp. The docs in lspconfig suggest that it is necessary, but mason takes care of that for you.

Oh very cool! That's good to know, awesome change!

> Looking at the :LspInfo output at the end, it seems fine to me. Is the server not working with that setup?

No, it doesn't seem to ever attach. The full-blown `:LspInfo` output confirms `0 client(s) to this buffer:` (full output at the bottom of this post)

Before I dive into that though, let me take a quick moment to clarify something on my end.

Looking back over your earlier post, I saw you had...
```
mason_lspconfig.setup({
  ensure_installed = servers,
})
```

Whenever I have it set up that way, none of the installed servers are recognized. When I open a related file, neovim immediately messages;
```
Spawning language server with cmd: `omnisharp-mono` failed. The language server is either not installed, missing from PATH, or not executable.
```

However, when I use the NON-masonized version:
```
lspconfig.setup({
  ensure_installed = servers,
})
```
The named servers are discovered and work okay (lua, bash, typescript, etc).

But this leaves me with an "empty" `mason_lspconfig.setup()` call just sitting there doing nothing.

I only kick-off with that just in case maybe there's something there on my end that's preventing the omnisharp/omnisharp-mono servers from working their magic.

---

Okay, so to dive back into omnisharp...

Immediately upon loading a `*.cs` file, the following message displays across the bottom

```
Client 1 quit with exit code 2 and signal 0
```

So I pull up the logs and see...

#### :LspLog
```
[START][2022-08-10 22:01:26] LSP logging initiated
[ERROR][2022-08-10 22:01:26] .../vim/lsp/rpc.lua:439	"rpc"	"omnisharp-mono"	"stderr"	"Cannot open assembly '/home/linux/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin/omnisharp/OmniSharp.exe': Not a directory.\n"
```

Which actually seems consintent with mason's current (new?) directory structure. Because while it's looking for an omnisharp directory within `/bin`, it now looks to be laid out differently

#### $ ls
```

$ ls

```

And as we'd expect, `:LspInfo` shows it unattached

Which, just for comparison, is different from what happens with `nvim-lsp-installer`. There, it will attach, the keymaps defined in `handlers.lua` work, it just won't do anything useful. Everything returns with "No information available".
